Search Engine Under Evaluation: Ask

Average Percent Overlap: 31.099999999999998

Average Spearman Coefficient: -2.566595238095238

The statistics show that Ask did not fair well in comparison to Google. If you look at the individual query statistics,
you will see that Ask is able to find overlapping results for only around 60 queries. Out of these 60 queries, 30
queries had a positive coefficient and 30 had a negative coefficient. The striking thing to note is that the average
negative coefficient is too low than how high the average positive coefficient is. This means that Ask disagrees with
Google much more than how much it agrees with it.
