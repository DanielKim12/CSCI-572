Search Engine Under Evaluation: Ask

Average Percent Overlap: 31.1

Average Spearman Coefficient: -2.57

The statistics show that Ask's results did not fair well in comparison to Google's results. If you look at the
individual statistics of queries, you will see that their Spearman Coefficient is remarkably low even for those
whose results overlapped a lot. This means that Ask is not able to find similar results as Google and even when
it does, their ranking is extremely polarising.
