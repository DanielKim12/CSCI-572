I was supposed to crawl www.usatoday.com, but after multiple attempts, I was blocked from the website. So, I switched to nytimes.com instead. As mentioned on Piazza, it is okay to switch (https://piazza.com/class/m0f6u1b51pe70d/post/266).

For reference: I am using Java 8 along with 4.4.1 jar files for crawler4j, as there seemed to be an issue with the 4.4.0 jar files.
