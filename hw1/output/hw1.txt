Search Engine Under Evaluation: Ask

Average Spearman Coefficient: -2.566595238095238

The statistics show that Ask's results did not fair well in comparison to Google's results. If you look at the
individual query statistics, you will see that the Spearman Coefficient is remarkably low even for those
whose results overlapped a lot. All in all, it can be said that Ask is not able to find many overlapping results
with Google and even when it does, it ranks them very differently.
